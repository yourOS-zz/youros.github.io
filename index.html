<p>Welcome to yourOS, a linux distro based on Gentoo.</p>
<p>yourOS is meant to be clean, simple, and very customizable.</p>
<p>yourOS is yours meaning you get to know everything that is happening on your computer and not have to worry about spyware or big corporations spying on you.</p>
<p>yourOS is also meant to be lightweight, meaning it can run on older computers as well (minimum specs TBA).</p>
